---

> **An AI-powered, real-time, hyperlocal cloudburst early warning and decision system**  
> combining **computer vision**, **temporal intelligence**, and **human-in-the-loop authority**.

---

## Overview

**Polaris** is a research-grade early warning and decision system designed to detect **cloudburst-like conditions before severe impact occurs**.  
Unlike traditional threshold-based systems, Polaris uses a **layered intelligence approach** that fuses:

- Visual understanding of the sky  
- Temporal pattern learning  
- Citizen-ground reports  
- Rule-based safety logic  
- Authority override controls  

The result is a **trustworthy, explainable, and deployable** disaster-support system.

## Key Capabilities

### Vision-Based Detection
- Camera-based sky monitoring (currently laptop camera)
- CNN learns cloud and storm visual patterns
- Works even before rainfall begins

### Temporal Intelligence
- LSTM model learns **how conditions evolve**
- Detects **rapid escalation**, not isolated frames
- Significantly reduces false positives

### Citizen Intelligence
- Citizen-uploaded images
- Water-level reports (Ankle / Knee / Waist)
- Human inputs influence risk but do not bypass safety logic

### Ensemble Risk Engine (v0.8)
- *Combines:*
- Rule-based safety logic
- CNN spatial probability
- LSTM temporal probability
- Trend / spike detection
- Feedback bias weighting
- Stability smoothing prevents brittle decision jumps
- Produces ensemble_score for consistent UI alignment

### Active Learning & ML Automation
- Uncertain sample queueing
- Feedback-aware retraining bias
- Auto-training triggered by feedback threshold
- *One-click ML pipeline:*
- Dataset build
- CNN retrain
- LSTM retrain
- Hot reload
- Sparse temporal datasets return SUCCESS_WITH_WARNINGS (no full failure)

### Dashboard & Visualization
- Production-grade command-center dashboard
- Global auto-refresh (no manual reload)
- Manual override dominance clearly indicated
- Interactive map with:
  - Live risk heatmap
  - Historical cloudburst incidents
  - Safe zones with confidence
- Designed for authority decision-making

### Authority Control (v0.4+)
- Manual authority override with global precedence
- Override applies instantly system-wide
- Fully auditable (author, reason, timestamp)

### Explainable Decisions
Every prediction includes:
- Risk score
- Risk level
- Confidence score
- AI probability (CNN)
- Temporal probability (LSTM)
- ETA, ETA confidence
- Decision mode (AUTOMATED / MANUAL_OVERRIDE)

---

## Authority Feedback Loop

- Alerts can be marked as:
  - TRUE_POSITIVE
  - FALSE_POSITIVE
  - LATE_DETECTION
- Feedback stored for **future retraining and evaluation**

---

## AI Models Used

### Spatial AI (CNN)
- Architecture: **MobileNetV2**
- Task: Identify high-risk cloud patterns
- Output: Probability of high-risk frame

### Temporal AI (LSTM)
- Input: Sequences of numeric features
- Learns escalation trends across time
- Core component for early warning

> ⚠️ Rule-based logic is **never removed** and always acts as a safety fallback.

---

Collections:
- `alerts` – alert metadata  
- `images` – image metadata  
- `predictions` – risk, confidence, AI outputs  
- `citizen_reports` – public inputs

---

## Notification & Alert Routing

- Triggered by final decisions published via Valkey
- Runs continuously once the system is started
- Manual override always supersedes AI decisions

### Phone Alert Setup (Dispatch Endpoint)

`POST /alert/dispatch` now delivers through **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) only**:
- `APP_NOTIFICATION`
- `PUSH_NOTIFICATION`
- `PUSH_SMS`
- `SMS_SIREN`
- `ALL_CHANNELS`

Required environment variables:
- `FCM_PROJECT_ID`
- `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE` (absolute path to Firebase service account JSON)
- `FCM_DEVICE_TOKENS` (optional, comma-separated FCM registration tokens)
- `FCM_TOPIC` (optional, topic name; default `polaris-alerts`)

Flutter app integration:
- Use `firebase_messaging` in the Flutter client.
- Subscribe the app to the configured topic (for example `polaris-alerts`) or register device tokens.
- Foreground handling can use Flutter local notifications if desired; backend delivery still stays FCM-only.

### Alert Severity Levels
- **INFO** – No alert
- **ADVISORY** – Stay alert
- **ALERT** – Prepare and restrict movement
- **EMERGENCY** – Immediate action required

---

## Postman Integration

- Used strictly for API testing and validation
- Helpful during development and debugging
- Not required for normal automated system operation
